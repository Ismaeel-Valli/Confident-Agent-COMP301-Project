Scope: API-claim and static evidence only. EWCS is not a probability of correctness. Task behavior has not been independently checked by this verifier.

Policy 2026-09-25.1: thresholds 0.85/0.6, uncertainty gate on.

Evidence:

- interface: requests maps to requests (2.34.2). Installation/callables checked separately by Pyright.
- identifier: No identifier, attribute or API-call diagnostics in the configured environment (Pyright standard mode). A clean check does not establish REST contracts or task behavior.
- access_point: GET https://air-quality-api.open-meteo.com/v1/air-quality matches the declared server and operation GET /v1/air-quality.
- input_contract: Required inputs, locations and supported value constraints checked for call_27_15 (/v1/air-quality). Noncritical: query.latitude: runtime value inputs['latitude'] is not statically known; its value constraints are not checked; query.longitude: runtime value inputs['longitude'] is not statically known; its value constraints are not checked
- output_contract: No tracked response-field accesses.
- contextual: No authentication requirement for this operation. Unused security definitions are not requirements.

Flag: some checks rely on supporting static or package metadata evidence; the code was not executed.
